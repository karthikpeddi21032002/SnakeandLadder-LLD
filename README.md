# Snake and Ladder - Low Level Design (LLD)

A simple, object-oriented implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder game in Java, designed for LLD interviews and extensibility.

## Project Structure

```
org.example
├── Board.java   // Board logic, snakes and ladders
├── Player.java  // Player model
├── Dice.java    // Dice rolling logic
├── Game.java    // Game engine and flow
├── Main.java    // Entry point
```

## How to Run
1. Compile the project using Maven or your IDE.
2. Run the `Main` class. The game will prompt each player to roll the dice in turn.

## Class Overview

### Board
- **Variables:**
  - `HashMap<Integer, Integer> snakes` — Maps snake heads to tails.
  - `HashMap<Integer, Integer> ladders` — Maps ladder bases to tops.
- **Constructor:**
  - `Board(HashMap<Integer, Integer> snakes, HashMap<Integer, Integer> ladders)`
- **Methods:**
  - `int getNextPosition(int position)` — Returns the new position after checking for snake or ladder.

### Player
- **Variables:**
  - `String name` — Player's name.
  - `String id` — Player's ID.
  - `int currPosition` — Current position on the board.
- **Methods:**
  - Getters and setters (generated by Lombok's `@Data` annotation).

### Dice
- **Methods:**
  - `int rolldice()` — Returns a random number between 1 and 6 (simulates a dice roll).

### Game
- **Variables:**
  - `Dice dice` — Dice instance for rolling.
  - `Board board` — The game board.
- **Constructor:**
  - `Game(Board board)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void startGame(Player p1, Player p2)` — Main game loop, alternates turns, handles user input, and prints game state.

### Main
- **Purpose:**
  - Sets up the board, snakes, ladders, and players.
  - Instantiates `Board`, `Game`, and starts the game.

## Example Usage
```
Player player1 = new Player("Alice", "1", 0);
Player player2 = new Player("Bob", "2", 0);
HashMap<Integer, Integer> snakes = new HashMap<>();
HashMap<Integer, Integer> ladders = new HashMap<>();
// ... populate snakes and ladders ...
Board board = new Board(snakes, ladders);
Game game = new Game(board);
game.startGame(player1, player2);
```

## Extending for Multiple Players

To support any number of players:
- Change the `startGame` method in `Game.java` to accept a `List<Player>`.
- In `Main.java`, create a `List<Player>` and add as many players as you want.
- The game loop will iterate through all players in turn.

**Example:**
```java
// In Main.java
List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();
players.add(new Player("Alice", "1", 0));
players.add(new Player("Bob", "2", 0));
players.add(new Player("Charlie", "3", 0)); // Add more players as needed

Board board = new Board(snakes, ladders);
Game game = new Game(board);
game.startGame(players); players
```

**Game.java (method signature):**
```java
public void startGame(List<Player> players) {
    int currentPlayer = 0;
    while (true) {
        Player player = players.get(currentPlayer);
        // ... rest of the logic ...
        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer + 1) % players.size();
    }
}
```

## Notes
- The game currently supports 2 players by default, but can be easily extended for more as shown above.
- All user interaction is via the console.
- Designed for clarity, extensibility, and LLD best practices.
